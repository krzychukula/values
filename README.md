# values

App to help prioritize values

This is an MVP built for:

1. Get a list of values in one place [values.kula.blog](http://values.kula.blog).
2. Build a simple web app without frameworks/build-tools and only with what I still remember before I started using React for everything.
3. Have an easy way of getting the order of values.
